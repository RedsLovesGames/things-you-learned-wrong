# Things You Learned Wrong

A lightweight site that tracks classroom "facts" that have been overturned by new evidence. Enter the year you graduated from high school (1980 or later) to see which ideas were still common in textbooks around that time along with primary sources that explain the correction.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build tools are requiredâ€”the data lives in `script.js` and styles in `styles.css`.

## Contributing corrections

If you remember other myths that persisted past 1980 and can cite a reputable source that debunks them, add a new entry to the `facts` array in `script.js` and submit a pull request.
