          Enter the year you graduated high school (1980 or later) to see which
          classroom "facts" have been overturned by new research. Every entry is
          paired with primary sources so you can check the evidence yourself.

        <p>
          This collection focuses on science, health, and social studies topics
          that were still printed in mainstream U.S. middle-school or high-school
          materials after 1980. Each card lists when the outdated idea was
          commonly taught, what current evidence says instead, and direct links to
          the research or institutional announcements that overturned the earlier
          classroom explanation.
